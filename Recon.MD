# Recon

## Some tips
   - Follow the marketing guys (e.g., Director or Manager) of the product you're targeting for #BugBounty. These guys are awesome in telling you all the new features that are in pipeline or just released. You will be the first to get your hands dirty
   - Always check an e-mail's headers and body. They often contain valuable information and endpoints
   - If a bounty target offers premium features, buy them and test the new endpoints. Most of the times, it's worth the investment!
   - Look for hackathon-related assets. Companies sometimes run hackathons and give attendees special access to certain API endpoints or temporary credentials. I have found GIT repositories that were set up for hackathons full of sensitive information
