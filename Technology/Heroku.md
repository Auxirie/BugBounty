# Heroku
  - try calling /app/Procfile to get the installation instructions that a dev had when deploying to heroku. If that loads and you know what stack it uses, you should be able to find the source code of the app in /app directory. For example if it is rails, you can pull routes.rb by calling /app/config/routes.rb. The app folder is the main directory where all deployed code is stored
